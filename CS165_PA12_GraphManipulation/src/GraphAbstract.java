     * Reads mileage chart from CSV file and builds lists of nodes (cities) and edges (distances).
     * <p>
     * The first line contains all the cities which should be represented as {@link GraphNode}s <br>
     * The successive lines start with a city, followed by a list of mileages to other cities.
     * <p>
     * To avoid redundancy, not all the values are filled in, ignore empty entries. <br>
     * When you read a mileage, for example from Fort Collins to Denver, create only one
     * entry in the mileages array, but add the edge to both cities.
     * <p>
     * First extract all the edges, then sort the edges by mileage, then add the edges
     * associated with each node.
     * @param filename the CSV file
